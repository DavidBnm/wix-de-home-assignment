## Architectural Design for Wix Comparison Chart Event Tracking

### 1. Business Context
Wix has introduced a **comparison chart** feature to help users compare different products and plans. To optimize conversion rates, the marketing team needs robust event tracking data to analyze user behavior. This includes:
- Tracking page views of the comparison chart
- Tracking clicks on affiliate links
- Handling high traffic volumes while ensuring data privacy
- Providing accessible and insightful analytics for business users

### 2. Data Architecture Overview

#### **2.1 Data Collection & Storage**
##### **Event Data (High-Volume, Real-Time) → Stored in BigQuery**
**Why BigQuery?**
- **Scalability**: Can handle millions of events per hour with minimal operational overhead.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay-as-you-go model ensures efficient pricing.
- **Query Performance**: Optimized for analytical queries, making it ideal for ad-hoc analysis.
- **Integration**: Easily connects with Google Cloud services and BI tools.

##### **Metadata (Users, Links, Products, Teams, etc.) → Stored in a SQL Database (e.g., PostgreSQL/MySQL)**
**Why SQL?**
- **Transactional Consistency**: ACID compliance ensures reliability for structured data.
- **Frequent Updates**: Supports CRUD operations for user profiles and product details.
- **Relational Integrity**: Ideal for structured relationships and complex joins.

### 3. Data Processing & Enrichment

#### **3.1 Raw Event Data Transformation**
##### **Apache Airflow Pipeline**
- Ingests raw event data from **BigQuery**.
- Applies business logic (e.g., **user segmentation, data deduplication, enrichment** with metadata).
- Transforms and stores cleaned data into:
  - **Optimized BigQuery tables** for analytical queries.
  - **SQL database tables** for relational joins and operational reporting.

##### **3.2 Real-Time Processing for Quick Insights**
- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub + Dataflow** for **real-time streaming** data processing.
- Immediate aggregation of key metrics and storage into **BigQuery**.

##### **3.3 Batch Processing for Historical Analysis**
- **Cloud Composer (Airflow) Pipelines** scheduled to process and enrich data periodically.
- Ensures historical data remains **clean and structured**.

---

### 4. Data Accessibility & Reporting

#### **4.1 Business Analyst Access via Metabase**
**Why Metabase?**
- **User-Friendly**: No SQL expertise required.
- **Scheduled Reporting**: Automate reports for specific analyst groups.
- **Role-Based Access**: Ensures data governance and security.

#### **4.2 Ad-Hoc & Scheduled Reports**
- Business analysts can explore **real-time and historical data** through Metabase dashboards.
- Reports are **scheduled and delivered** via email/Slack.

---

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting

- **Google Cloud Monitoring** for real-time pipeline health checks.
- **Prometheus + Grafana** for tracking **query performance** and system metrics.
- **Airflow Alerts** to detect **failures in data transformation pipelines**.

### 6. Implementation Considerations

#### **6.1 Development Approach & Timeline**
| Phase | Task | Estimated Time |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1** | Set up event tracking and BigQuery ingestion | 2 weeks |
| **Phase 2** | Develop Airflow pipelines for transformation | 3 weeks |
| **Phase 3** | Configure Metabase for analytics | 2 weeks |
| **Phase 4** | Implement monitoring & alerting | 1 week |
| **Phase 5** | Testing and deployment | 2 weeks |

#### **6.2 Testing Strategy**
- **Unit Tests** for Airflow DAGs (ensure correct transformations).
- **Data Quality Checks** (validate expected row counts and consistency in BigQuery and SQL DB).
- **Load Testing** (simulate high event loads to ensure system stability).

#### **6.3 Deployment & Operations**
- **CI/CD Pipelines** (Terraform + GitHub Actions) for **infrastructure as code**.
- **Incremental Deployment Strategy** (phased rollout to minimize risks).
- **Ongoing Performance Tuning** (optimize queries and storage).

### 7. Conclusion
This architecture ensures **scalable, cost-efficient, and user-friendly data tracking** for Wix’s comparison chart. The combination of **BigQuery for event data, SQL databases for metadata, Airflow pipelines for transformation, and Metabase for analysis** provides a robust and future-proof solution.
